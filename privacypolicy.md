Privacy Policy for DocuFinder

At ASquare Labs, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our mobile application. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information.

1. Information We Collect
Locally Stored Data: All personal and official documents that you upload to the app are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to these documents, nor do we store them on any external servers.
Google Drive Integration: If you choose to back up your documents to your Google Drive, the app will use your Google account to upload and download your documents. This interaction is solely between your app and your Google Drive. We do not access, share, or store any information from your Google Drive account.
2. How We Use Your Information
Local Storage: The documents and data you upload are stored locally on your device and are not shared with anyone. The app does not transmit your data to any third-party services except Google Drive, and only at your discretion for backup and restoration purposes.
Google Drive Backup: If you enable the backup feature, the app will upload your selected documents to your personal Google Drive account. The data stored on Google Drive remains under your control, and DocuFinder does not share or access this data.
3. Data Sharing
We do not collect, share, or sell any of your personal information to third parties. The app does not share any data with external services, including the app owner. Your documents are fully under your control.

4. Data Security
We prioritize the security of your personal information:

Your documents are stored securely on your device.
Google Drive backups are secured by Googleâ€™s encryption and authentication mechanisms.
5. Your Control Over Your Data
You have complete control over the documents and information you store in the app:

You can manage, delete, or update your documents at any time from your device.
You can choose to back up or restore your documents using Google Drive at your discretion.
Deleting the app will remove all locally stored documents from your device, but any backups made to Google Drive will remain accessible from your Google account.
6. No Data Collection
We do not collect any personal information, usage data, or analytics from your use of the app. As a result, we do not use cookies, trackers, or any analytics tools.
